I am sharing files of this project.

### Intro
This web connects small businesses with lenders and surety bonding companies and provides real opportunities for businesses to connect with lenders who are committed to helping them find the right funding. 

The front-end is developed in Vue3 & backend is in laravel.


### challeges
I am a fullstack developer, I am having good knowledge of APIs; from creating APIs to implementing them at the front-end. so I did not face any difficulties with the requirement & functionality but making UI was really challenging with vue3.


I had to create dashboard which contains number of different types of charts (column, bar, pie, donut etc.) That time Vue3 was just launched & I was unable to find packages compatible to Vue3. Not only for chart but also for multiselect dropdown, checkbox, import/export etc. and as a developer, to maintain code quality & work efficiently we always prefer packages. So this was quite complex to implement.

Finally I found apexcharts but again as label was too large and data was also so bulky, I worked so hard to make it responsive. I kept searching & finding all possible options provided by apexchart. And for other things like table sorting, pagination etc. I created my own code without implmenting any package. 
Fortunately, now we have many packages for vue3 so I won't face that again.
